In this assignment: Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs are used and the npm init, and package son. Files created keys.js, .env, randon.txt.   This file will be used by the `dotenv` package to set what are known as environment variables to the global `process.env` object in node.  3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'` * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:  ``` * Title of the movie. * Year the movie came out. * IMDB Rating of the movie. * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie. * Country where the movie was produced. * Language of the movie. * Plot of the movie. * Actors in the movie.  ``` * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'  4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`  * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.  * It should run `spotify-this-song` for \"I Want it That Way,\" as follows the text in `random.txt`.",
